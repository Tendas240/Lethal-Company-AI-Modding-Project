# 00 — Current State

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL HUMAN STATE  
**Generated from:** `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json`  
**Updated:** 2026-09-15  
**Game:** Lethal Company V81

## Project execution policy

Every ChatGPT chat performing project work must follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. This controls task segmentation/checkpoints, not gameplay lifecycle state.

## Accepted baseline

**S1.42AH — Mouth Dog Pikmin Dual Prevention — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AH Mouth Dog Fix.r2z`  
SHA-256: `06e07fe6805e5e41786c16b5c1ea2132c4f65b385517c902f8aa566ccf49cd4e`  
Acceptance: `Current/142_S1.42AH_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MOUTHDOG_DUAL_PREVENTION.md`  
Runtime evidence: `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AH/20260909T162513Z/`

## Latest built artifact

**S1.42AI-DIAG1R2 — ShyGuy Isolation Diagnostic EndlessElevator Applicability Repair — BUILT STATIC MATERIALIZED VALIDATED AWAITING RUNTIME CANDIDATE ACTIVATION NOT ACCEPTED**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AI-DIAG1R2 ShyGuy Isolation Applicability Repair.r2z`  
SHA-256: `9dd67d6ea015274596e11651a8c1a842d50c7f7b913332794cce43d389169d15`  

A historical rejection can remain preserved even when a later explicit decision changes the build's live lifecycle status. Current status is controlled by `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus the latest build-specific decision evidence.

## Live execution state

- Active candidate: **none**
- Runtime test outstanding: **no**
- Successor armed: **no**
- `BuildSpecs/current.json`: disabled (`IDLE_AFTER_S1.42AI-DIAG1R2_MATERIALIZED_VALIDATION_AWAITING_RUNTIME_CANDIDATE_ACTIVATION`)
- Guarded build base: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AH Mouth Dog Fix.r2z` / `06e07fe6805e5e41786c16b5c1ea2132c4f65b385517c902f8aa566ccf49cd4e`
- `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AI-DIAG1R1`

## Exact next action

S1.42AI-DIAG1R2 is built and repository-natively static/materialized validated. The next project action is a separate coordinated lifecycle transition that, after re-verifying the exact R2 profile/evidence and no-candidate state, activates R2 as the runtime diagnostic candidate, moves RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt to R2, changes the disabled BuildSpecs guard from accepted S1.42AH to R2, updates candidate/project-state and artifact-integrity authorities, and only then sets runtime_test_outstanding = true. Do not import/test R2 before that transition. The full-normal S1.42AI gate remains deferred, not waived.

No new runtime test is pending. A completed run may still require its build-specific PowerShell uploader before evidence ingestion; `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt` controls runtime-evidence attribution and does not itself promote a build.

## Where current truth lives

Use `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md` for execution cadence, `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` for semantic routing and `Current/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md` for current-vs-history precedence. Durable gameplay/config invariants live in the relevant `Knowledge/*.md` topic rather than being duplicated here.

Build history is indexed by `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md`; artifact and runtime-evidence readability is indexed by `Current/ARTIFACT_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY.md`.
