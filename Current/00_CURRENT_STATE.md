# 00 — Current State

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL HUMAN STATE  
**Generated from:** `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json`  
**Updated:** 2026-09-27  
**Game:** Lethal Company V81

## Project execution policy

Every ChatGPT chat performing project work must follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. This controls task segmentation/checkpoints, not gameplay lifecycle state.

## Accepted baseline

**S1.42AK — LC Office Camera Enemy Balance — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK LC Office Camera Enemy Balance.r2z`  
SHA-256: `b39aa550a517ec727de6eb1ae825383933047d3c556cb6e8d4aa7611c9f89dee`  
Acceptance: `Current/158_S1.42AK_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_LC_OFFICE_CAMERA_ENEMY_BALANCE.md`  
Runtime evidence: `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK/20260918T172838Z/`

## Latest built artifact

**S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 — Black Mesa Deep Sewers Size Fix — ACTIVE RUNTIME CANDIDATE NOT ACCEPTED**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 Black Mesa Deep Sewers Size Fix.r2z`  
SHA-256: `3f9c7fd5c21c532528db1ddae36764ada73236b7527c6ab2ae1b982c3976b7b0`  
Candidate record: `Current/174_S1.42AK_BMDSFIX1_RUNTIME_ACTIVATION.md`  

A historical rejection can remain preserved even when a later explicit decision changes the build's live lifecycle status. Current status is controlled by `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus the latest build-specific decision evidence.

## Live execution state

- Active candidate: **S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1**
- Runtime test outstanding: **yes**
- Successor armed: **no**
- `BuildSpecs/current.json`: disabled (`IDLE_UNIVERSAL_INTERIOR_VIABILITY_ANALYSIS`)
- Guarded build base: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 Black Mesa Deep Sewers Size Fix.r2z` / `3f9c7fd5c21c532528db1ddae36764ada73236b7527c6ab2ae1b982c3976b7b0`
- `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1`

## Exact next action

Prepare and execute a separately bounded exact-byte publication checkpoint for S1.42AK-BMGHDIAG3 using only the already reviewed bytes from GitHub Actions artifact 10929208327 produced by review run 36311706288. Verify artifact ZIP SHA-256 20f616e85585e10631c31e09844a27bb6bb7649843a98655ed70e37b89152198 and publish the exact reviewed profile SHA-256 7ab3dae8f5b215219d81bba37645853be0f253ac981118d176f5f9cfa28e7ace with exact S142AKBMGHDiag3.dll SHA-256 d40966c23ac5eb17249d18be7e544a2a0e8ede52c9235abaac475d2372aa1352; do not rebuild. In that publication checkpoint do not modify/import Gale, runtime-arm BMGHDIAG3, start gameplay, change RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt from S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1, enable BuildSpecs/current.json, or change BMDSFIX1 acceptance. Black Mesa x Greenhouse remains NOT_YET_PROVEN until a later separately authorized runtime checkpoint.

A runtime test is pending for S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1. `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt` controls runtime-evidence attribution and does not itself promote a build.

## Where current truth lives

Use `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md` for execution cadence, `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` for semantic routing and `Current/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md` for current-vs-history precedence. Durable gameplay/config invariants live in the relevant `Knowledge/*.md` topic rather than being duplicated here.

Build history is indexed by `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md`; artifact and runtime-evidence readability is indexed by `Current/ARTIFACT_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY.md`.
