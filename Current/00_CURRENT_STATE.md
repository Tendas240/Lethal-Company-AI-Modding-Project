## Project execution policy

Every ChatGPT chat performing project work must follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. This controls task segmentation/checkpoints, not gameplay lifecycle state.

## Accepted baseline

**S1.42AK — LC Office Camera Enemy Balance — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK LC Office Camera Enemy Balance.r2z`  
SHA-256: `b39aa550a517ec727de6eb1ae825383933047d3c556cb6e8d4aa7611c9f89dee`  
Acceptance: `Current/158_S1.42AK_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_LC_OFFICE_CAMERA_ENEMY_BALANCE.md`  
Runtime evidence: `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK/20260918T172838Z/`

## Latest built artifact

**S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 — Black Mesa Deep Sewers Size Fix — ACTIVE RUNTIME CANDIDATE NOT ACCEPTED**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 Black Mesa Deep Sewers Size Fix.r2z`  
SHA-256: `3f9c7fd5c21c532528db1ddae36764ada73236b7527c6ab2ae1b982c3976b7b0`  
Candidate record: `Current/174_S1.42AK_BMDSFIX1_RUNTIME_ACTIVATION.md`  

A historical rejection can remain preserved even when a later explicit decision changes the build's live lifecycle status. Current status is controlled by `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus the latest build-specific decision evidence.

## Live execution state

- Active candidate: **S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1**
- Runtime test outstanding: **yes**
- Successor armed: **no**
- `BuildSpecs/current.json`: disabled (`IDLE_UNIVERSAL_INTERIOR_VIABILITY_ANALYSIS`)
- Guarded build base: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 Black Mesa Deep Sewers Size Fix.r2z` / `3f9c7fd5c21c532528db1ddae36764ada73236b7527c6ab2ae1b982c3976b7b0`
- `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1`

## Exact next action

Decide only whether to authorize a later, separately bounded S1.42AK-SCDIAG1 exact-byte publication of the single frozen GitHub Actions artifact ID 11581745624 (producer head 3e1680298b794d392a6938c9b734ecb649b2eea1; outer ZIP SHA-256 9971c22f162ef61177b57f2e350bba5289f5fa09dd78cff65ccd82fcadb0d730; review profile SHA-256 6be6865a7fde205280439503680ac910401c20b997f757ffbedbddc963c704f4; DLL SHA-256 2bd49852973c04c89dceea5b8dc9e75b051bc9a95c16850af08fb37dc3113131). This is an authorization decision only: no new build, archive reconstruction, artifact replacement/download, publication, profile-index mapping, Gale import, activation, runtime attempt, gameplay acceptance, controller change or owner/LLL/normalizer/availability/RNG change. Preserve DIAGNOSTIC ONLY / NEVER ACCEPT, Phase-C residual 23 = 11 viable/equal-100 plus 12 unchanged owner-hard-block, S1.42AK accepted and BMDSFIX1 active NOT ACCEPTED with its passive selector-free Black Mesa x DeepSewersFlow gate unwaived.

A runtime test is pending for S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1. `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt` controls runtime-evidence attribution and does not itself promote a build.

## Where current truth lives

Use `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md` for execution cadence, `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` for semantic routing and `Current/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md` for current-vs-history precedence. Durable gameplay/config invariants live in the relevant `Knowledge/*.md` topic rather than being duplicated here.

Build history is indexed by `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md`; artifact and runtime-evidence readability is indexed by `Current/ARTIFACT_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY.md`.
