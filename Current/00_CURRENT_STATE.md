# 00 — Current State

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL HUMAN STATE  
**Generated from:** `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json`  
**Updated:** 2026-09-14  
**Game:** Lethal Company V81

## Project execution policy

Every ChatGPT chat performing project work must follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. This controls task segmentation/checkpoints, not gameplay lifecycle state.

## Accepted baseline

**S1.42AH — Mouth Dog Pikmin Dual Prevention — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AH Mouth Dog Fix.r2z`  
SHA-256: `06e07fe6805e5e41786c16b5c1ea2132c4f65b385517c902f8aa566ccf49cd4e`  
Acceptance: `Current/142_S1.42AH_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_MOUTHDOG_DUAL_PREVENTION.md`  
Runtime evidence: `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AH/20260909T162513Z/`

## Latest built artifact

**S1.42AI-DIAG1R1 — ShyGuy Isolation Diagnostic Owner Type Resolution Repair — RUNTIME DIAGNOSTIC FAILED COMPLEX OWNER TARGET RESOLUTION REPAIR ANALYSIS REQUIRED NOT ACCEPTED**

Profile: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AI-DIAG1R1 ShyGuy Isolation Repair.r2z`  
SHA-256: `b83165ae27d9fa3b926c3f66701ba5c7a5db57b29f6136ab212c0fa2d2cfecdd`  
Candidate record: `Current/146_S1.42AI-DIAG1R1_BUILD_CANDIDATE_OWNER_TYPE_RESOLUTION_REPAIR.md`  

A historical rejection can remain preserved even when a later explicit decision changes the build's live lifecycle status. Current status is controlled by `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus the latest build-specific decision evidence.

## Live execution state

- Active candidate: **none**
- Runtime test outstanding: **no**
- Successor armed: **no**
- `BuildSpecs/current.json`: disabled (`IDLE_AFTER_S1.42AI-DIAG1R1_RUNTIME_FAILURE_AWAITING_REPAIR_ANALYSIS`)
- Guarded build base: `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AH Mouth Dog Fix.r2z` / `06e07fe6805e5e41786c16b5c1ea2132c4f65b385517c902f8aa566ccf49cd4e`
- `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AI-DIAG1R1`

## Exact next action

Analyze repository-native why S1.42AI-DIAG1R1 required the exact complex-owner type ElevatorMod.Patches.EndlessElevator although that type was absent at runtime. Reconcile the installed profile/package reality with the static/materialized validation contract, determine the exact safe repair without guessed CLR identities, and only then build/validate a successor diagnostic candidate if required. No gameplay test is currently outstanding. The full-normal S1.42AI gate remains deferred, not waived.

No new runtime test is pending. A completed run may still require its build-specific PowerShell uploader before evidence ingestion; `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt` controls runtime-evidence attribution and does not itself promote a build.

## Where current truth lives

Use `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md` for execution cadence, `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` for semantic routing and `Current/DOCUMENT_AUTHORITY.md` for current-vs-history precedence. Durable gameplay/config invariants live in the relevant `Knowledge/*.md` topic rather than being duplicated here.

Build history is indexed by `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md`; artifact and runtime-evidence readability is indexed by `Current/ARTIFACT_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY.md`.
