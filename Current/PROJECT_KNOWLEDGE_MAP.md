# Project Knowledge Map

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL ROUTER
**Authority:** primary human topic router for repository knowledge
**Machine Mirror:** `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.json`
**Current State:** `Current/00_CURRENT_STATE.md`
**Project execution policy:** `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`
**Last-Validated:** 2026-09-25

Before performing project work, read and follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. Route normal questions through the registered canonical topic; current lifecycle facts come from `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus that topic, not old handovers.

## Current lifecycle anchor

Accepted gameplay baseline: **S1.42AK — LC Office Camera Enemy Balance — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**. Active gameplay candidate / latest built gameplay artifact: **S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 — not accepted**.

Acceptance authority: `Current/158_S1.42AK_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_LC_OFFICE_CAMERA_ENEMY_BALANCE.md`. Full-normal runtime evidence is `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK/20260918T172838Z/` with raw log SHA-256 `cc0f0a7a6c6a76ad44266aded11ff9cb2aca21f2623f5fb895d371ad778526b9`. The first attempt in that session was aborted before interior entry. The played second attempt naturally selected Spooky Manor and supplied roughly three minutes of interior coverage without a hostile enemy sighting; that is a documented coverage limitation, not a proven spawn regression.

The targeted LC Office camera-render A/B remains supplied by completed diagnostic-only S1.42AJ-DIAG2 evidence. The later LC Office Scrap Quantity/Distribution Investigation is complete with no gameplay delta under `Current/163_S1.42AK_SCRAPDIAG1_RUNTIME_PLACEMENT_FINDING.md`. S1.42AK remains accepted/latest and unchanged.

**Universal Interior Viability / Equal Availability is the selected scope.** Phases A through C2 remain complete with the fixed 30×53 matrix unchanged at 662 `VIABLE_EQUAL_100`, 14 `AUTHOR_OR_OWNER_HARD_BLOCK`, 0 `CONFIG_GAP`, 0 `KNOWN_TECHNICAL_RESTRICTION`, and 914 `NOT_YET_PROVEN`.

Both exact Black Mesa x Greenhouse diagnostic attempts remain completed failed diagnostic evidence. BMGHDIAG2 is ingested at `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK-BMGHDIAG2/20260924T124542Z/` and refused before arming on `EntranceTeleport manifest module identity mismatch`, so Black Mesa x Greenhouse remains `NOT_YET_PROVEN`.

The separate pair-scoped `S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1` Deep Sewers mitigation remains the **active gameplay runtime candidate / not accepted**. Exact runtime evidence is ingested at `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1/20260924T170032Z/` with raw log SHA-256 `9a8cf28bbfc050cf9247cffacc890ea1b4e7215329db4ecfc9085f3f8f0ff2cb`. The run armed BMDSFIX1 but Black Mesa selected Substation, so no `APPLIED` marker occurred; this is preserved as the exact-byte non-target control. The remaining regular gameplay gate is only Black Mesa x `DeepSewersFlow`; decision authority: `Current/175_S1.42AK_BMDSFIX1_PARTIAL_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE_NON_TARGET_CONTROL.md`. `BuildSpecs/current.json` remains disabled while guarding the exact BMDSFIX1 candidate.

The published/indexed `S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1-DIAG1` still occupies the runtime/evidence pointer, but two consecutive launches are documented as preloader-blocked before diagnostic execution and the long-name profile must not be rerun. Its identity-only successor `S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1-DIAG1PATH1` is now exact-byte published and canonically indexed: profile `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-D1P1.r2z`, SHA-256 `0d4fc0b2031099617a43770b29ab1908a2be18a262df70a3322904f458cff5c6`, canonical index result `ProfileSources/S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1-DIAG1PATH1/PROFILE_INDEX_RESULT.json`, 338 archive members, `EXPECTED_HASHES` resolution. It remains not runtime-armed, diagnostic support only and never acceptable as gameplay. The immediate repository task is a separate explicit DIAG1PATH1 runtime-activation checkpoint; do not import or run it before that gate is integrated and validated. BMDSFIX1 remains not accepted, its regular qualification remains outstanding and unwaived, accepted baseline remains S1.42AK, and Black Mesa x Greenhouse/BMGHDIAG remains separate.

## Authority rule

`Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` is the global machine lifecycle authority. This map chooses semantic topics. Build-specific records/runtime evidence prove decisions and observations but historical files never override later current state.

When the user requests a new-chat handover, route to `Current/HANDOVER_PREPARATION_PROMPT.md` and re-verify repository/CI state before producing it.

## Historical navigation

Use `Current/03_PROJECT_CHRONOLOGY.md`, `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md/.json`, numbered build-specific `Current/*S1.*` files, `ProfileSources/`, and `RuntimeEvidence/` for history. `Current/02_TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md` and `Current/07_FUTURE_ROADMAP_BCMER_INTERIORS.md` are not unqualified current-state authority.
