# Project Knowledge Map

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL ROUTER
**Authority:** primary human topic router for repository knowledge
**Machine Mirror:** `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.json`
**Current State:** `Current/00_CURRENT_STATE.md`
**Project execution policy:** `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`
**Last-Validated:** 2026-09-14

Before performing project work, read and follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. Route normal questions through the registered canonical topic; current lifecycle facts come from `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus that topic, not old handovers.

## Current lifecycle anchor

Accepted gameplay baseline: **S1.42AH — Mouth Dog Pikmin Dual Prevention — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**.

Latest built artifact and active diagnostic runtime candidate: **S1.42AI-DIAG1R1 — ShyGuy Isolation Diagnostic Owner Type Resolution Repair — NOT ACCEPTED**. Runtime test outstanding: **yes**. Candidate authority: `Current/146_S1.42AI-DIAG1R1_BUILD_CANDIDATE_OWNER_TYPE_RESOLUTION_REPAIR.md`; runtime contract: `AnalysisEvidence/S1.42AI-DIAG1R1/MINIMAL_GUARD_CONTRACT.md`; materialized validation: `AnalysisEvidence/S1.42AI-DIAG1R1/MATERIALIZED_VALIDATION.md`.

`BuildSpecs/current.json` is disabled at `IDLE_AFTER_S1.42AI-DIAG1R1_BUILD_AWAITING_RUNTIME`. `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AI-DIAG1R1` and `Current/AUTO_BUILD_RESULT.json.build_id = S1.42AI-DIAG1R1` identify the exact ready candidate for import and evidence attribution.

The next action is one R1 diagnostic gameplay run followed by the exact R1 log upload and repository-native ingestion. The failed predecessor S1.42AI-DIAG1 must not be rerun unchanged. The ordinary S1.42AI full-normal BCMER ShyGuy acceptance gate remains explicitly deferred and not waived.

## Authority rule

`Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` is the global machine lifecycle authority. This map chooses semantic topics. Build-specific records/runtime evidence prove decisions and observations but historical files never override later current state.

When the user requests a new-chat handover, route to `Current/HANDOVER_PREPARATION_PROMPT.md` and re-verify repository/CI state before producing it.

## Historical navigation

Use `Current/03_PROJECT_CHRONOLOGY.md`, `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md/.json`, numbered build-specific `Current/*S1.*` files, `ProfileSources/`, and `RuntimeEvidence/` for history. `Current/02_TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md` and `Current/07_FUTURE_ROADMAP_BCMER_INTERIORS.md` are not unqualified current-state authority.
