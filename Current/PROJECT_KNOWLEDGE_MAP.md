## Current lifecycle anchor

Accepted gameplay baseline: **S1.42AK — LC Office Camera Enemy Balance — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**. Active gameplay candidate / latest built gameplay artifact: **S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 — not accepted**.

The selected **Universal Interior Viability / Equal Availability** scope remains in Phase C3. The fixed Phase-B3 30x53 availability/effective-weight matrix remains an unchanged historical snapshot at 662 `VIABLE_EQUAL_100`, 14 `AUTHOR_OR_OWNER_HARD_BLOCK`, 0 `CONFIG_GAP`, 0 `KNOWN_TECHNICAL_RESTRICTION`, and 914 `NOT_YET_PROVEN`; pair-specific Phase-C evidence and current applicability findings do not rewrite those historical classifications.

`Current/206_S1.42AK_EXTERNAL_OWNER_RULE_APPLICABILITY_CLOSURE_RECONCILIATION.md` closes the Phase-C3 External owner-rule applicability / External semantics gate from existing repository-native source/owner/config evidence. Black Mesa current applicability is `31 MATCH / 22 NON-MATCH / 0 UNRESOLVED`. This is selection/availability-layer evidence only: the 31 matches are not automatic runtime-compatibility passes and the 22 non-matches are not technical-incompatibility findings. No duplicate Black Mesa registration is needed or authorized.

The already-ingested concrete Black Mesa pair evidence remains bounded to Greenhouse, Slaughterhouse, ExpandedFacility, Decrepit store / StoreFlow and Substation. Greenhouse is the full bounded pair-specific runtime-compatibility PASS; the other records retain narrower topology/traversal boundaries. No additional already-ingested Black Mesa pair is available for the same evidence-only reconciliation path. Decision: `Current/205_S1.42AK_EXTERNAL_MOON_EXISTING_EVIDENCE_EXHAUSTION_RECONCILIATION.md`.

Oxyde remains governed by `SourceEvidence/UniversalInteriorViability/PhaseC3E3H/FINDINGS.md`: 23 positive selection/metadata matches exist, but exact V81 skips ordinary dungeon generation while `spawnEnemiesAndScrap=false`, and no independent inspected dungeon/entrance-construction path is established. Those metadata matches are not executable ordinary pair proof.

The bounded **S1.42AK-BMAFDIAG1** Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry diagnostic has completed source/static integration, inactive review build, exact-byte publication and canonical profile indexing. Authorities: `Current/207_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_SOURCE_STATIC_INTEGRATION_RECONCILIATION.md` through `Current/210_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_PROFILE_INDEX_RECONCILIATION.md`. Exact profile SHA-256 is `b8611f58678890065f214f788051c203f4d72c59040e53e51c64c89c5958fdc2`; exact diagnostic DLL SHA-256 is `c079368dd3736decadee00125a42319f5da29907aad207d7b82a6494f19a7ce1`.

Runtime activation from `Current/211_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_RUNTIME_ACTIVATION.md` was integrated and exact-head CI-green, but the first local launch subsequently exposed the path-length blocker reconciled by `Current/212_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_PATH_LENGTH_BLOCK_AND_GUARD_RECONCILIATION.md`. The named runtime DLLs were physically present, while their full local paths were exactly 260 and 262 characters. The current long BMAFDIAG1 identity is therefore **DO NOT RERUN** and is no longer an executable diagnostic target. This is preloader launch-block evidence, not a runtime rejection; Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry remains `NOT_YET_PROVEN`. Runtime/evidence routing has been returned to `S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1` without accepting it.

The separately versioned identity-only successor **S1.42AK-BMAFDIAG1PATH1** is published and canonically indexed, but its bounded Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry runtime attempt is now completed failed diagnostic evidence under `Current/219_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1PATH1_RUNTIME_REFUSAL_AND_CONFIG_BINDING_ROOT_CAUSE_RECONCILIATION.md`. Exact evidence `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK-BMAFDIAG1PATH1/20261001T195721Z/` / raw log SHA-256 `ccb38f7173a109a103f5dbc67e06d4acf60f86f95652a2db566f8b2c63a98521` shows BMAFDIAG1 armed, then LLL returned Abandoned Foundry as unviable on Black Mesa and the diagnostic correctly emitted `REFUSED`. The root cause is the LLL config-category identity: real LLL 1.7.12 Custom Dungeon categories use exactly nine U+200B sorting characters, while the published Foundry section used a plain header; the generic builder created the wrong category and the BMAFDIAG1 validator removed Unicode `Cf` characters during header comparison, masking the mismatch. PATH1 is therefore **DO NOT RERUN / DIAGNOSTIC ONLY / NEVER ACCEPT** and Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry remains `NOT_YET_PROVEN`. Runtime/evidence routing is returned to S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 without accepting it.

The separately versioned short repair successor **S1.42AK-BMAFR1** has completed inactive raw config-binding review and exact-byte publication. Publication authority is `Current/221_S1.42AK_BMAFR1_EXACT_BYTE_PUBLICATION_CHECKPOINT.md`; integration closure is `Current/222_S1.42AK_BMAFR1_PUBLICATION_INTEGRATION_RECONCILIATION.md`. Successful transport run `36987697299` / #2 materialized frozen artifact `11218000891` byte-for-byte without rebuilding. Publication PR #218 final head `6146217ac398d509e65caf7ff070cf398e6df5f6` passed Knowledge Architecture run `36989222843` / #942 and merged to main as `9284778b16f95fb27e9ec35f3c4008fc9367ce47`; permanent exact-head main run `36989414492` / #943 passed. Exact published profile `Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-BMAFR1.r2z` has SHA-256 `8607a022e83304b473e7327ce5644141212a697fb8dffa210c58e02e5caafba5`. Automatic profile-index run `36989414554` / #31 failed closed before mutation because the profile lacks a canonical build mapping, so BMAFR1 is published but not indexed, not Gale-imported and not runtime-armed. Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry remains `NOT_YET_PROVEN`.

BMGHDIAG3 remains completed Black Mesa x Greenhouse runtime-compatibility PASS evidence / **DIAGNOSTIC ONLY / NEVER ACCEPT** and is not runtime-active. S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 remains the separate active gameplay candidate / **NOT ACCEPTED**; its regular exact-byte Black Mesa x `DeepSewersFlow` qualification remains passive, outstanding and unwaived. `BuildSpecs/current.json` and `AUTO_BUILD_RESULT` remain BMDSFIX1 authorities.

Exact next action: Execute the separately bounded S1.42AK-BMAFR1 profile-index mapping reconciliation. Register the exact published profile path Profiles/LC V1 S1.42AK-BMAFR1.r2z with build ID S1.42AK-BMAFR1 and SHA-256 8607a022e83304b473e7327ce5644141212a697fb8dffa210c58e02e5caafba5 in the canonical mapping authority required by BuildSystem/index_profile.py, following the existing BMAFDIAG1 and BMAFDIAG1PATH1 precedents. Then let the profile-index workflow generate and commit the canonical BMAFR1 profile-index result under its existing snapshot directory and verify the exact-head Knowledge Architecture gate. Do not Gale-import, runtime-arm, start gameplay, change RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt, accept or waive S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1, or rerun BMAFDIAG1PATH1 during this index gate.

## Authority rule

`Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` is the global machine lifecycle authority. This map chooses semantic topics. Build-specific records/runtime evidence prove decisions and observations but historical files never override later current state.

When the user requests a new-chat handover, route to `Current/HANDOVER_PREPARATION_PROMPT.md` and re-verify repository/CI state before producing it.

## Historical navigation

Use `Current/03_PROJECT_CHRONOLOGY.md`, `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md/.json`, numbered build-specific `Current/*S1.*` files, `ProfileSources/`, and `RuntimeEvidence/` for history. `Current/02_TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md` and `Current/07_FUTURE_ROADMAP_BCMER_INTERIORS.md` are not unqualified current-state authority.
