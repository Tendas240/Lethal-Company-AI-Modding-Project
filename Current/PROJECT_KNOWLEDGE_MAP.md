# Project Knowledge Map

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL ROUTER
**Authority:** primary human topic router for repository knowledge
**Machine Mirror:** `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.json`

Before performing project work, read and follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. Route normal questions through the registered canonical topic; current lifecycle facts come from `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus that topic, not old handovers.

## Current lifecycle anchor

Accepted gameplay baseline and latest built artifact: **S1.42AK — LC Office Camera Enemy Balance — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**.

Acceptance authority: `Current/158_S1.42AK_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_LC_OFFICE_CAMERA_ENEMY_BALANCE.md`. Full-normal runtime evidence is `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK/20260918T172838Z/` with raw log SHA-256 `cc0f0a7a6c6a76ad44266aded11ff9cb2aca21f2623f5fb895d371ad778526b9`. The first attempt in that session was aborted before interior entry. The played second attempt naturally selected Spooky Manor and supplied roughly three minutes of interior coverage without a hostile enemy sighting; that is a documented coverage limitation, not a proven spawn regression.

The targeted LC Office camera-render A/B remains supplied by completed diagnostic-only S1.42AJ-DIAG2 evidence. The later LC Office Scrap Quantity/Distribution Investigation is complete with no gameplay delta under `Current/163_S1.42AK_SCRAPDIAG1_RUNTIME_PLACEMENT_FINDING.md`. S1.42AK remains accepted/latest and unchanged.

**Universal Interior Viability / Equal Availability is the selected scope.** Phases A through C2 remain complete with the fixed 30×53 matrix unchanged at 662 `VIABLE_EQUAL_100`, 14 `AUTHOR_OR_OWNER_HARD_BLOCK`, 0 `CONFIG_GAP`, 0 `KNOWN_TECHNICAL_RESTRICTION`, and 914 `NOT_YET_PROVEN`.

Both exact Black Mesa x Greenhouse diagnostic attempts remain completed failed diagnostic evidence. BMGHDIAG2 is ingested at `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AK-BMGHDIAG2/20260924T124542Z/` and refused before arming on `EntranceTeleport manifest module identity mismatch`, so Black Mesa x Greenhouse remains `NOT_YET_PROVEN`.

The separate pair-scoped `S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1` Deep Sewers mitigation has now passed source/static integration, inactive review build, exact-byte publication, and main integration. PR #150 exact head `24713dfc93a24f5e65ae5f223d3ea9c164da785e` merged at `21138185f1ab377660b61120f1d07733d4180672` after exact-head Knowledge Architecture `36023454162`, source/pure-static `36023454260`, and publication-aware archive `36023454215` all passed; permanent main Knowledge Architecture push run `36024694126` also passed. The main-integrated profile SHA-256 is `3f9c7fd5c21c532528db1ddae36764ada73236b7527c6ab2ae1b982c3976b7b0` and BMDSFIX1 DLL SHA-256 is `f337da49f4a0e75bf2753e17e3abc52cdbea56ba37eddec5f1065b17f4d75a92`; the 337-member archive/index, zero package/config drift, LLL/normalizer identities and readable ProfileSources snapshot remain unchanged. BMDSFIX1 is **on main but not runtime-armed**. `BuildSpecs/current.json` remains disabled, `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AK`, no active candidate exists and no runtime test is outstanding. The next action is a separate atomic runtime-activation checkpoint; no gameplay run is yet authorized. The B3 matrix, ownership boundaries and Black Mesa x Greenhouse successor-diagnostic task remain unchanged.

## Authority rule

`Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` is the global machine lifecycle authority. This map chooses semantic topics. Build-specific records/runtime evidence prove decisions and observations but historical files never override later current state.

When the user requests a new-chat handover, route to `Current/HANDOVER_PREPARATION_PROMPT.md` and re-verify repository/CI state before producing it.

## Historical navigation

Use `Current/03_PROJECT_CHRONOLOGY.md`, `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md/.json`, numbered build-specific `Current/*S1.*` files, `ProfileSources/`, and `RuntimeEvidence/` for history. `Current/02_TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md` and `Current/07_FUTURE_ROADMAP_BCMER_INTERIORS.md` are not unqualified current-state authority.
