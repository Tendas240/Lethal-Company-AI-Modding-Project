# Project Knowledge Map

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL ROUTER
**Authority:** primary human topic router for repository knowledge
**Machine Mirror:** `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.json`
**Current State:** `Current/00_CURRENT_STATE.md`
**Project execution policy:** `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`
**Last-Validated:** 2026-09-16

Before performing project work, read and follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. Route normal questions through the registered canonical topic; current lifecycle facts come from `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus that topic, not old handovers.

## Current lifecycle anchor

Accepted gameplay baseline and latest built artifact: **S1.42AI — BCMER ShyGuy Interior-Only Event Correction — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**. Exact profile SHA-256: `d993bc0fca265fe7a2b069bd654b5e2c1f590623eaf7f4fabb325f8b4d863cb2`. Acceptance authority: `Current/152_S1.42AI_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_BCMER_SHYGUY_INTERIOR_ONLY.md`; runtime evidence: `RuntimeEvidence/S1.42AI/20260916T180452Z/`.

S1.42AH is the accepted predecessor/rollback provenance baseline. The S1.42AI-DIAG1/R1/R2/R3 chain remains diagnostic evidence only; R3 passed exact ShyGuy identity/isolation but is not a gameplay baseline.

There is no active runtime candidate and no outstanding runtime test. `BuildSpecs/current.json` is disabled at `IDLE_AFTER_S1.42AI_ACCEPTANCE_AWAITING_NEXT_SCOPE`. `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt = S1.42AI` remains evidence attribution only and does not arm a successor.

The next action is to select exactly one remaining deferred independent scope from `Knowledge/ROADMAP_AND_DEFERRED_SCOPES.md` before preparing any successor.

## Authority rule

`Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` is the global machine lifecycle authority. This map chooses semantic topics. Build-specific records/runtime evidence prove decisions and observations but historical files never override later current state.

When the user requests a new-chat handover, route to `Current/HANDOVER_PREPARATION_PROMPT.md` and re-verify repository/CI state before producing it.

## Historical navigation

Use `Current/03_PROJECT_CHRONOLOGY.md`, `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md/.json`, numbered build-specific `Current/*S1.*` files, `ProfileSources/`, and `RuntimeEvidence/` for history. `Current/02_TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md` and `Current/07_FUTURE_ROADMAP_BCMER_INTERIORS.md` are not unqualified current-state authority.
