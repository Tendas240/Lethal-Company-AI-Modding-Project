# Project Knowledge Map

**Status:** CURRENT / CANONICAL ROUTER
**Authority:** primary human topic router for repository knowledge
**Machine Mirror:** `Current/PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_MAP.json`
**Current State:** `Current/00_CURRENT_STATE.md`

**Last-Validated:** 2026-09-30

Before performing project work, read and follow `Current/CHATGPT_SEGMENTED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md`. Route normal questions through the registered canonical topic; current lifecycle facts come from `Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` plus that topic, not old handovers.

## Current lifecycle anchor

Accepted gameplay baseline: **S1.42AK — LC Office Camera Enemy Balance — ACCEPTED FULL NORMAL STACK**. Active gameplay candidate / latest built gameplay artifact: **S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 — not accepted**.

The selected **Universal Interior Viability / Equal Availability** scope remains in Phase C3. The fixed Phase-B3 30x53 availability/effective-weight matrix remains an unchanged historical snapshot at 662 `VIABLE_EQUAL_100`, 14 `AUTHOR_OR_OWNER_HARD_BLOCK`, 0 `CONFIG_GAP`, 0 `KNOWN_TECHNICAL_RESTRICTION`, and 914 `NOT_YET_PROVEN`; pair-specific Phase-C evidence and current applicability findings do not rewrite those historical classifications.

`Current/206_S1.42AK_EXTERNAL_OWNER_RULE_APPLICABILITY_CLOSURE_RECONCILIATION.md` closes the Phase-C3 External owner-rule applicability / External semantics gate from existing repository-native source/owner/config evidence. Black Mesa current applicability is `31 MATCH / 22 NON-MATCH / 0 UNRESOLVED`. This is selection/availability-layer evidence only: the 31 matches are not automatic runtime-compatibility passes and the 22 non-matches are not technical-incompatibility findings. No duplicate Black Mesa registration is needed or authorized.

The already-ingested concrete Black Mesa pair evidence remains bounded to Greenhouse, Slaughterhouse, ExpandedFacility, Decrepit store / StoreFlow and Substation. Greenhouse is the full bounded pair-specific runtime-compatibility PASS; the other records retain narrower topology/traversal boundaries. No additional already-ingested Black Mesa pair is available for the same evidence-only reconciliation path. Decision: `Current/205_S1.42AK_EXTERNAL_MOON_EXISTING_EVIDENCE_EXHAUSTION_RECONCILIATION.md`.

Oxyde remains governed by `SourceEvidence/UniversalInteriorViability/PhaseC3E3H/FINDINGS.md`: 23 positive selection/metadata matches exist, but exact V81 skips ordinary dungeon generation while `spawnEnemiesAndScrap=false`, and no independent inspected dungeon/entrance-construction path is established. Those metadata matches are not executable ordinary pair proof.

The bounded **S1.42AK-BMAFDIAG1** Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry diagnostic has completed source/static integration, inactive review build, exact-byte publication and canonical profile indexing. Authorities: `Current/207_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_SOURCE_STATIC_INTEGRATION_RECONCILIATION.md` through `Current/210_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_PROFILE_INDEX_RECONCILIATION.md`. Exact profile SHA-256 is `b8611f58678890065f214f788051c203f4d72c59040e53e51c64c89c5958fdc2`; exact diagnostic DLL SHA-256 is `c079368dd3736decadee00125a42319f5da29907aad207d7b82a6494f19a7ce1`.

The next bounded transition is the runtime activation recorded by `Current/211_S1.42AK_BMAFDIAG1_RUNTIME_ACTIVATION.md`. After that activation is integrated and exact-head CI-green, `RuntimeInbox/ACTIVE_BUILD.txt` identifies `S1.42AK-BMAFDIAG1` solely for Gale target resolution and runtime-evidence attribution. The permanent v2.4.3 Gale resolver binds this direct diagnostic to exact accepted S1.42AK through `CURRENT_STATE.selected_scope.diagnostic_revision` plus its build-result identity. BMAFDIAG1 remains **DIAGNOSTIC ONLY / NEVER ACCEPT** and Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry remains `NOT_YET_PROVEN` until runtime evidence is decided.

BMGHDIAG3 remains completed Black Mesa x Greenhouse runtime-compatibility PASS evidence / **DIAGNOSTIC ONLY / NEVER ACCEPT** and is not runtime-active. S1.42AK-BMDSFIX1 remains the separate active gameplay candidate / **NOT ACCEPTED**; its regular exact-byte Black Mesa x `DeepSewersFlow` qualification remains passive, outstanding and unwaived with no dedicated reroll released. `BuildSpecs/current.json` remains disabled.

Exact next action after activation integration: import exact BMAFDIAG1 through the canonical Gale v2.4.3 launcher, run one bounded Black Mesa x Abandoned Foundry diagnostic, exercise required entrance IDs 0..3 in both directions where practical, and upload the exact BMAFDIAG1 log with its build-specific standalone uploader. No profile/DLL/config/package rebuild or gameplay acceptance is authorized.

## Authority rule

`Current/CURRENT_STATE.json` is the global machine lifecycle authority. This map chooses semantic topics. Build-specific records/runtime evidence prove decisions and observations but historical files never override later current state.

When the user requests a new-chat handover, route to `Current/HANDOVER_PREPARATION_PROMPT.md` and re-verify repository/CI state before producing it.

## Historical navigation

Use `Current/03_PROJECT_CHRONOLOGY.md`, `Current/BUILD_LINEAGE.md/.json`, numbered build-specific `Current/*S1.*` files, `ProfileSources/`, and `RuntimeEvidence/` for history. `Current/02_TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md` and `Current/07_FUTURE_ROADMAP_BCMER_INTERIORS.md` are not unqualified current-state authority.
