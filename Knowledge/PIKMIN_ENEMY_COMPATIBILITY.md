## Ownership principle

Native LethalMin owns normal Pikmin -> enemy combat, enemy death handling, latch removal, task completion, dead-body carry and Onion delivery. Project-local code blocks only proven Enemy -> Pikmin gaps and must preserve that native lifecycle.

Never repeat the S1.42R whole-component disable of `LethalMin.BaboonBirdPikminEnemy`. Disabling that component also suppressed inherited `PikminEnemy.Update()` death/unlatch cleanup.

## Baboon Hawk

Accepted asymmetric rule:

- Baboon Hawk -> Pikmin collision/bite/grab: blocked narrowly;
- Pikmin -> Baboon Hawk attack: allowed/native;
- `BaboonBirdPikminEnemy`: stays **enabled**;
- native death/unlatch lifecycle: preserved.

The compatibility source validates exact declared Hawk adapter entry points and uses the common `PikminAI.GrabPikmin(Transform,float,int)` prevention-only guard rather than manual follower-state reconstruction.

## Thumper / Crawler

The proven Enemy -> Pikmin broken grab path is blocked before it can mutate leader/grab/death-timer state.

Current accepted LethalMin configuration:

- `Thumper Bite Limit = 3`;
- `Crawler` is **not** in the Pikmin Attack Blacklist.

Do not revert to complete two-way noninteraction. Pikmin counterattack remains intended.

## Puffer / Spore Lizard

Puffer -> Pikmin smoke/effect interaction is protected by removing the LethalMin-injected Pikmin effect-trigger components from Puffer smoke. This is targeted protection, not a broad enemy disable.

## CodeRebirth utility kills

The cumulative compatibility plugin also shields Pikmin/Puffmin from CodeRebirth utility kill RPCs, providing a direct failsafe for gaps such as Autonomous Crane kills even when corresponding LethalMin toggles are already false.

## Diagnostic EnemyIsolation

EnemyIsolation was temporary test infrastructure only and defaults off. Do not treat the old isolated allowlist as normal gameplay state and do not restore continuous global EnemyAI scanning.

## Patch safety

Any future change to these interactions is high risk and must follow `Current/68_PROJECT_LOCAL_PATCH_SAFETY_AND_REGRESSION_POLICY.md`:

- inspect exact owner/method/inheritance/lifecycle first;
- prefer prevention before state mutation;
- isolate risky patch deltas;
- test target behavior, adjacent lifecycle, reverse direction, repetition and neighboring behavior;
- compile/startup success alone is not acceptance.
